# Super Market Kata

We value the ability to model problems in software, so our first assessment will be around that subject. The exercise is to model and code a simple supermarket pricing solution. It is inspired on Pragmatic Dave’s Supermarket Kata - http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/.

You are to deliver code that prices a supermarket shopping basket. Some items available are based on price per item, some items are based on weight. There are also group discounts to be aware of:

- Three cans of beans for the price of two.
- Two cans of Coke, for £1.


Use the following example of a receipt to know what data needs to be captured. There is no requirement to actually format or print a receipt.

    Beans                0.50
    Beans                0.50
    Beans                0.50
    Coke                 0.70
    Coke                 0.70
    Oranges
    0.200 kg @  £1.99/kg 0.40
                        -----
    Sub-total            3.30

    Savings
    Beans 3 for 2       -0.50
    Coke 2 for £1       -0.40
                        -----
    Total savings       -0.90
    -------------------------
    Total to Pay         2.40


**Keep it simple and to the point, no web, persistence, ORM layers or frameworks.**

**Don't try and invent complex money classes, but don't fall for classic Java Money issues.**

**What we want to see is what classes you create, their responsibility and relationships with other classes.**

1. Think how to make pricing and discounts flexible
2. Think about immutability
3. Apply S.O.L.I.D principles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)
4. Show us how you write clean code.

**We will run your code over our static analysis tool, so make sure it doesn't have any issues!**
